#Teampicker very early version

Simple tool to learn HTML5 local storage and try some jQuery/jQuery UI. *Very* early version, but usable.

##What is it for?

I was in need for a tool to keep track of team members in activities during experiential course with a lot (30) people. This was really hard with pen and paper, nobody was patient enough to write down the teams after each activity. The aim is to have offline, run-anywhere, easy to use and foolproof tool to easily keep track of team members that already have been or never been together in an activity.
